# The-monty-hall-problem
You are a contestant on a game show. There are three doors: behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. The game proceeds as follows:

You choose one of the three doors, let's say Door 1.
Before revealing what is behind your chosen door, the game host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. Let's say the host opens Door 3 to reveal a goat.
Now, you have a choice to stick with your original choice (Door 1) or switch to the remaining unopened door (Door 2).
The question is, should you stick with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door to maximize your chances of winning the car?

The solution to the Monty Hall problem is that you should always switch doors. By switching, your chances of winning the car increase from the initial 1/3 to 2/3.

Here's a simple explanation:

Initially, you have a 1/3 chance of choosing the car and a 2/3 chance of choosing a goat. When the host reveals a goat behind one of the other doors, that new information changes the probabilities. The remaining unopened door now has a 2/3 chance of having the car, while your initially chosen door still has a 1/3 chance.

Switching doors essentially means you are betting on the remaining unopened door, which has a higher probability of having the car (2/3) compared to your initially chosen door (1/3).

This counterintuitive result can be further understood by considering the possible scenarios and their probabilities. If you always switch, you win the car if your initial choice was a goat, which has a 2/3 probability. If you stick with your initial choice, you only win if your initial choice was the car, which has a 1/3 probability.

Therefore, the optimal strategy to maximize your chances of winning the car in the Monty Hall problem is to always switch doors after the host reveals a goat behind one of the other doors.
